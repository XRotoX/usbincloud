# React

React is a front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It helps writing cleaner code using react hooks introduced in react 16.8, which enables using functions rather than classes and components life cycle management.

# Material-ui

Material-ui is a powerful, user experience first library, highly inspired by Google material design. With it's demo driven documentation, it's easier to create interactive components in a flexible way, making time to market smaller for a front-end dev.

Checkout the [installation](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/) guide and make your first react app using Material-ui.

Alternatively, [material.io](https://material.io/collections/get-started) is the official Google ressource for best practises and ready to implement components for wide usage(Angular, react...).
